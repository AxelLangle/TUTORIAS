# Dynamic Academic Period Logic (Cuatrimestres)

**USAR CUANDO:**
When implementing or modifying features related to academic periods (cuatrimestres, semesters, etc.) in educational software, especially when the user requests dynamic calculation based on the current date.

**CONTENIDO:**
When developing or modifying software for educational institutions, the logic for calculating or displaying academic periods (like "cuatrimestres" or semesters) should be dynamic and based on the current date. The specific logic is:
- September - December: 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th cuatrimestres.
- January - April: 2nd, 5th, and 8th cuatrimestres.
- May - August: 3rd, 6th, and 9th cuatrimestres.
The program must detect the stage of the year and, based on that, show the available cuatrimestres to date. This dynamic calculation must be applied wherever the user is prompted to select or view the current cuatrimestre.
